Welcome to my **Kaggle Competitions** repository ðŸš€

This repository contains my collection of notebooks and projects from various Kaggle competitions. Here, I apply my knowledge and skills to solve real-world challenges using Python programming language and popular libraries such as `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and more.

If you have any q's or recommendations don't hesitate to let me know. You can reach me out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bravo-diego/).
